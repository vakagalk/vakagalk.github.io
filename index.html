			<div class="tekstas2"> The best fashion blogs don't just give you incredible style advice—they give you inspiration. Fashion blogs engage you in interesting 
			content and provide new ideas on the subject of fashion and the surrounding creative world. Sure, everyone wants great outfit ideas for their Pinterest boards and dream 
			wardrobes, but fashion isn't just about looking perfect. It can be an expression of who you are and how you want to represent yourself in the world.
			Fashion is a popular style, especially in clothing, footwear, lifestyle, accessories, makeup, hairstyle and body.[citation needed] Fashion is a distinctive and often constant trend in the style in which people present themselves.
			A fashion can become the prevailing style in behaviour or manifest the newest creations of designers, technologists, engineers, and design managers.
			Because the more technical term costume is regularly linked to the term "fashion", the use of the former has been relegated to special senses like fancy-dress or masquerade wear, while 
			the word "fashion" often refers to clothing, including the study of clothing. Although aspects of fashion can be feminine or masculine, some trends are androgynous.
			High-flying trendsetters in fashion can aspire to the label haute couture. But if one disapproves of a fashion, one can attempt to dismiss it as a mere fad.</div>
